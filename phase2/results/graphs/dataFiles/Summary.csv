Conclusions:
	The RTT reduces significantly comparing requests to a single RM against multiple RMs
		Ex: RTT in single RM-Read is higher than multiple RM-Read
			RTT in single RM-Write is higher than multiple RM-Write

	In the case of a mix of Read & Write involved transactions the client seems to come to a exhausted scenario soon where the middleware is able to handle the requests. Hence, they seems to crash sooner.

	Comparing Read & Write mixed transaction in 1-RM and Multiple-RM, the 1-RM seems to perform better.
